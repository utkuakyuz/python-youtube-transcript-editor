let's summarize the plot of Oedipus Rex
0:12
in the introduction to the play it's
0:15
explained that Oedipus king of Thebes
0:16
arrived years before in the city he now
0:19
rules as a stranger after the death of
0:22
King Laius he was given the crown
0:23
because he saved the city from the
0:25
Sphinx during the rising action
0:27
Oedipus sends Creon his brother-in-law
0:29
to consult Apollo about how to stop the
0:32
plague
0:32
Creon reports that Oedipus must find
0:35
Leia TSA's killer and avenge his death
0:36
in order to save his people from this
0:38
pestilence the chorus suggests to
0:41
Oedipus that he consult the old blind
0:43
prophet Tiresias
0:44
who ultimately declares Oedipus as the
0:46
cause of the plague
0:47
Oedipus accuses tiresias of plotting
0:50
with Creon to seize his throne before
0:52
leaving Tiresias tells Oedipus that the
0:54
killer is in Thebes and will become
0:56
blind and will turn out to be both the
0:58
son and husband of his mother
1:01
Oedipus accuses Creon of plotting
1:03
against him and the men argue until
1:04
Jocasta Oedipus's wife intercedes
1:07
Oedipus sends Creon out of the palace
1:09
without punishing him
1:10
Jocasta then tells Oedipus of a prophecy
1:13
that a son of hers with Laius would kill
1:15
his father
1:15
she and leia spinned the child's ankles
1:18
together and had a shepherd put him in
1:19
the wilderness to avoid the prophecy
1:21
Laius was killed at a place where three
1:23
roads meet presumably by robbers but
1:26
Oedipus recognizes this place and these
1:28
circumstances and asks Jocasta to send
1:31
for the remaining witness of Laius death
1:33
a slave he also tells Jocasta about his
1:36
parents in Corinth but he's been told
1:38
they're not as real parents years ago he
1:40
received the same prophecy that he would
1:42
marry his mother have children with her
1:44
and kill his father
1:45
Oedipus ran away from Corinth to escape
1:47
the prophecy but on the way he met with
1:50
travelers at a crossroads
1:51
one of whom hit him Oedipus ended up
1:53
killing them all Jocasta sends for the
1:55
slave who witnessed it the chorus sings
1:58
that if the prophecy is not actually
2:00
true their religious faith is in danger
2:02
of dying a messenger arrives and says
2:05
Oedipus is indeed not the real son of
2:07
the people he thought were his parents
2:09
was a gift from a shepherd who found him
2:12
with his ankles bound and that the
2:13
shepherd who gave the child to the
2:15
messenger to give to the couple who
2:17
raised him was the very slave they have
2:19
called to share what he witnessed when
2:21
Laius was killed
2:22
Jocasta realizes the truth and
2:24
frantically leaves during the climax of
2:27
Oedipus Rex the shepherd is called in
2:29
hand
2:30
under duress confirms the prophecy is
2:32
true Jocasta hangs herself an Oedipus
2:35
uses the broaches from her clothes to
2:37
put out his eyes so he will no longer
2:39
see the horror that is his life during
2:41
the falling action
2:42
Creon takes pity on Oedipus and wants to
2:45
keep him at the palace but Oedipus
2:46
insists on banishment leaving his
2:48
children behind for he now has no power
2:50
over them in the brief resolution the
2:53
chorus sings bitterly of the unhappy
2:55
tale how a powerful man has fallen and
2:58
how death is the only thing that will
2:59
bring happiness to mortals
3:01
